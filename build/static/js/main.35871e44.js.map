node in the traversal, and calling the\n * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n *\n * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *         // @return\n *         //   undefined: no action\n *         //   false: skip visiting this node\n *         //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n *         //   null: delete this node\n *         //   any value: replace this node with the returned value\n

leave() functions, a visitor can\n * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to four permutations of\n * visitor API:\n *\n * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       Kind(node) {\n *         // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 2) Named visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of\n *    a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       Kind: {\n *         enter(node) {\n *           // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *         leave(node) {\n *           // leave the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node) {\n *         // enter any node\n *       },\n *       leave(node) {\n *         // leave any node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 4) Parallel visitors for entering and leaving nodes of a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       enter: {\n *         Kind(node) {\n *           // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *       },\n *       leave: {\n *

After this only fields \"between\" sets are compared.\n *\n * B) Also, if any fragment is referenced in a selection set, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the original set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment.\n *\n * C) Also, if multiple fragments are referenced, then comparisons\n * are made \"between\" each referenced fragment.\n *\n * D) When comparing \"between\" a set of fields and a referenced fragment, first\n * a comparison is made between each field in the original set of fields and\n * each field in the the referenced set of fields.\n *\n * E) Also, if any fragment is referenced in the referenced selection set,\n * then a comparison is made \"between\" the original set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment (recursively referring to step D).\n *\n * F) When comparing \"between\" two fragments, first a comparison is made between\n * each field in the first referenced set of fields and each field in the the\n * second referenced set of fields.\n *\n * G) Also, any fragments referenced by the first must be compared to the\n * second, and any fragments referenced by the second must be compared to the\n * first (recursively referring to step F).\n *\n * H) When comparing two fields, if both have selection sets, then a comparison\n * is made \"between\" both selection sets, first comparing the set of fields in\n * the first selection set with the set of fields in the second.\n *\n * I) Also, if any fragment is referenced in either selection set, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the other set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment.\n *\n * J) Also, if two fragments are referenced in both selection sets, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the two fragments.\n *\n */\n\n// Find all conflicts found \"within\" a selection set, including those found\n// via spreading in fragments.

returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n\t * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n\t *\n\t * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original
